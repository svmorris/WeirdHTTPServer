# Project goals

The goal of this project is to create a developer profile website, but do it entirely custom.

Planned basic componenets:
- Node static webserver (from raw sockets)
- Custom backend scripting system
  - Im currently thinking of creating a python based backend system,
  - but following the design of php, where a script file is just placed
  - in a static directory. I know this is weird and ungodly, but it sounds fun.
- Custom sanitization libraries
- SSL implementation(?) (Im still not sure if I will do this)
- Custom component based front end library (I do not want to code bare html, but also dont want to use a library)

# Why?
I haven't written anything in javascript for a while, need to re-familiarise myself. When completed, this project could prove useful.
