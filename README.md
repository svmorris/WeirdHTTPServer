# Project goals

The goal of this project is to create a developer profile website, but do it entirely custom.


What this project has:
- Webserver written in node, using only the socket API
- Custom backend scripting system
  > I've implemented the backend scripting system using individual python scripts similarly to how PHP functions. I know its an odd system, but it was interesting to implement

Working on:
- Basic Error management

Planned features:
- Example website
  > Creating an example website will help iron out bugs and complete the erro management system
- Documentation

# Why?

I like building weird projects, and I like proving to myself that programs where the common consensus is "Do not build yourself but use a library", can still be built by regular people. Obviously with much more limited features. For this reason, I am also considering attempting a custom ssl implementation for my server.

I also needed a little reminder of how to write javascript.
